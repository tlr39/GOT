        Taylor and Joe are both students at Pitt Greensburg. Game of Thrones was a topic that both students enjoyed working on to create a website for our digital humanities class fall of 2020. Through COVID, we used the web as a means to communicate with eachtoher, our student instructor Amber and Dr. Campbell to discuss our thoughts and create our final project. Now here we have it, our Game of Thrones website!
