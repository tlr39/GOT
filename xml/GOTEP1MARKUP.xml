<title> EPISODE 1- WINTERFELL </title>
TITLE SEQUENCE
<stageDirection> EXT. </stageDirection> WINTER TOWN - DAY
A young boy runs through a snowy forest woods, he crosses a shallow stream and then runs through the streets of the winter town. As he runs through the town, pigs squeal and donkeys bray. He reaches the street and stands among a large crowd, struggling to see what is happening on the road. A man steps aside and the boy pushes through. Pan up to see <char house="Stark">ARYA</char> STARK smiling as she watches the boy run through. A large army is marching along the road and the boy continues to run alongside them. He finds a tree and climbs up it to get a good view. Pan up to see the army marching along the road from the winter town up to Winterfell. A man's shout can be heard, and the boy turns to face the rear of the army. Pan around to see the large army of <char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> TARGARYEN. Cut to the middle of the army marching through the streets, <char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> and <char house="Stark">JON</char> SNOW atop their horses. Cut to <char house="Stark">ARYA</char>, she looks at <char house="Stark">JON</char> and smiles, she starts to speak but says nothing as he rides by. Many people of the town stare at the troops marching through. <char house="Clegane"> SANDOR </char> "THE HOUND" CLEGANE is on a horse of his own with the army. <char house="Stark">ARYA</char> sees him but says nothing. <char house="Baratheon"> GENDRY </char> is also riding on a horse, <char house="Stark">ARYA</char> looks at him and smiles as he goes past.
<direction> CUT TO </direction>: HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE

A carriage is among the army and it carries within it <char house="Lanister">TYRION</char> LANNISTER who sits opposite LORD <char> VARYS </char>.

<char house="Lanister">TYRION</char>: You should consider yourself lucky. At least your balls wonâ€™t freeze off.

<char> VARYS </char>: You take great offense at dwarf jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes. Why is that?

<char house="Lanister">TYRION</char>: Because I have balls, and you don't.

The army continues to march and MISSANDEI and GREY WORM ride alongside each other. The villagers stare at them disapprovingly. People also stare at <char house="Stark">JON</char> and <char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> as they ride past.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders.

A dragon roars and the villagers look up at the sky in fear. People start clamouring as <char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>â€™ dragons, DROGON and RHAEGAL, fly overhead. <char house="Stark">ARYA</char> emerges from the crowd smiling. The dragons swoop over Winterfell and <char house="Stark">SANSA</char> STARK watches them fly overhead from the walls of Winterfell.

<direction> CUT TO </direction>: WINTERFELL â€“ FRONT GATE

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> and <char house="Stark">JON</char> ride into Winterfell towards a crowd of people standing within. <char house="Stark">BRAN</char> STARK is sitting at the front of the crowd. <char house="Stark">JON</char> rides up to him and dismounts his horse. He walks up to <char house="Stark">BRAN</char> and kisses him on the forehead.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: Look at you.

<char house="Stark">JON</char> sniffles.
 

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: You're a man.

<char house="Stark">BRAN</char>: Almost.

<char house="Stark">JON</char> looks at him quizzically and then up to <char house="Stark">SANSA</char> who is standing next to him. He walks up to her and gives her a hug. <char house="Mormont"> JORAH</char> MORMONT and <char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> watch from behind.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: Where's Arya?

<char house="Stark">SANSA</char>: Lurking somewhere.

<char house="Stark">JON</char> turns around to <char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> and she walks over to him.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell.

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>: Thank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark. The North is as beautiful as your brother claimed, as are you.

<char house="Stark">SANSA</char> looks at <char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> hesitantly.

<char house="Stark">SANSA</char>: Winterfell is yours, Your Grace.

<char house="Stark">BRAN</char>: We don't have time for all this. The Night King has your dragon.

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> turns to look at <char house="Stark">BRAN</char>.

<char house="Stark">BRAN</char>: He's one of them now. The Wall has fallen, the dead march south.
<char house="Stark">SANSA</char>, <char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> and <char house="Stark">JON</char> all look at each other concerned.

<direction> CUT TO </direction>: WINTERFELL â€“ LARGE HALL

<char house="Stark">SANSA</char>: As soon as we heard about the Wall, I called all our banners to retreat to Winterfell. Lord Umber when can we expect your people to arrive?

A young boy stands up from the side of the room and walks forwards.

<char house="Umber"> UMBER </char>: We need more horses and wagons, if it please my lady.

He stops and then turns to look at <char house="Stark">JON</char>.

<char house="Umber"> UMBER </char>: And my lord.

He stops again and then turns to look at <char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>.

<char house="Umber"> UMBER </char>: And my queen. Sorry.

<char house="Stark">SANSA</char>: You'll have as many as we can spare. Hurry back to Last Hearth and bring your people here.

<char house="Umber"> UMBER </char> bows and walks out the hall as people chatter.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well. There's no sense in manning the castles anymore. We make our stand here.

MAESTER <char house="Bolton"> WOLKAN </char>: At once, Your Grace.
<char house="Bolton"> WOLKAN </char> exits.

<char house="Mormont"> LYANNA </char> MORMONT: "Your Grace."

<char house="Mormont"> LYANNA </char> stands up and walks forwards

<char house="Mormont"> LYANNA </char>: But youâ€™re not. Are you? You left Winterfell a king and came back a- Iâ€™m not sure what you are now.

People start murmuring.

<char house="Mormont"> LYANNA </char>: A lord? Nothing at all?

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: It's not important.

<char house="Mormont"> LYANNA </char>: Not important? We named you King in the North.

People start cheering.

MAN: King of the North!

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: You did, my lady. It was the honor of my life. Iâ€™ll always be grateful for your faith. But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North. I chose the North.

People murmur. <char house="Lanister">TYRION</char> stands up and walks to the centre of the room.

<char house="Lanister">TYRION</char>: If anyone survives the war to come, we'll have Jon Snow to thank. He risked his life to show us the threat is real. Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen. We have brought two full-grown dragons. And soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause.

People grumble and yell out indistinctly.

<char house="Lanister">TYRION</char>: I know, I know, our people haven't been friends in the past. But we must fight together now or die.

<char house="Stark">SANSA</char>: May I ask, how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen? While I ensured our stores would last through winter, I didn't account for Dothraki, Unsullied and two full-grown dragons. What do dragons eat, anyway?

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>: Whatever they want.

<direction> CUT TO </direction>: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD

Many men move around wagons full of dragonglass. One man knocks a bit out of a wagon and <char house="Baratheon"> GENDRY </char> catches it before it hits the ground.

<char house="Baratheon"> GENDRY </char>: Hey, careful, lads. We need every last bit of it.

MAN 1: Sorry â€™bout that.

<char house="Baratheon"> GENDRY </char> climbs into the back of one of the wagons.

<char house="Baratheon"> GENDRY </char>: Are these the last of the wagons?

The camera cuts to <char house="Lanister">TYRION</char> who is watching over the courtyard.

MAN 2 (O.S.): Aye.

<char house="Baratheon"> GENDRY </char> (O.S.): All right, let's get it all to the forges.

<char house="Lanister">TYRION</char> walks up to <char house="Stark">SANSA</char> and YOHN <char house="Royce"> ROYCE </char>.

<char house="Lanister">TYRION</char>: My lord. My lady.

<char house="Royce"> ROYCE </char> turns to look at <char house="Stark">SANSA</char>, who nods back.

<char house="Royce"> ROYCE </char>: My lady.

<char house="Royce"> ROYCE </char> exits.

<char house="Lanister">TYRION</char>: The Lady of Winterfell. Has a nice ring to it.

<char house="Stark">SANSA</char>: So does Hand of the Queen. Depending on the queen, I suppose.

<char house="Lanister">TYRION</char>: Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding. Miserable affair.

<char house="Stark">SANSA</char>: It had its moments.

They both glance at each other, remembering the murder of JOFFREY BARA<char house="Greyjoy"> THEON </char>.

<char house="Stark">SANSA</char>: Apologies for leaving like that.

<char house="Lanister">TYRION</char>: Yes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder.

<char house="Stark">SANSA</char>: We both survived.

<char house="Lanister">TYRION</char>: Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now.

There is a short silence.

<char house="Lanister">TYRION</char>: I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear the Lannister army's marching north. You have every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do. But I promise, you'll be safe-

<char house="Stark">SANSA</char>: Cersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you?

<char house="Lanister">TYRION</char>: She did.

<char house="Stark">SANSA</char>: And you believed her?

<char house="Lanister">TYRION</char>: She has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive.

<char house="Stark">SANSA</char>: I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.

<char house="Stark">SANSA</char> exits and <char house="Lanister">TYRION</char> turns to see <char house="Stark">BRAN</char> staring at him from the courtyard.

<direction> CUT TO </direction>: WINTERFELL - GODSWOOD

<char house="Stark">JON</char> stands next to the weirwood tree and looks at the face carved into the trunk

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char> (O.S.): You used to be taller.

<char house="Stark">JON</char> turns around to see <char house="Stark">ARYA</char> standing near him.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: How did you sneak up on me?

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char>: How did you survive a knife through the heart?

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: I didn't.

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char> laughs, they both run towards each other and embrace. Once they break from their hug, <char house="Stark">JON</char> looks down to see <char house="Stark">ARYA</char>'s sword and scoffs in disbelief.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: You still have it.

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char> unsheathes her sword.

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char>: Needle.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: Have you ever used it?

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char>: Once or twice.

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char> puts Needle away. <char house="Stark">JON</char> pulls out his sword, Longclaw, and hands it to <char house="Stark">ARYA</char>.

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char>: Valyrian steel.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: Jealous?

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char> scoffs.

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char>: Too heavy for me.

<char house="Stark">JON</char> sheaths his sword and puts his hand on <char house="Stark">ARYA</char>'s shoulder.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: Where were you before? I could've used your help with Sansa.

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char>: She doesn't like your queen, does she?

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char>: She's the smartest person I've ever met.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: Now you're defending her?

<char house="Stark">JON</char> chuckles.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: You?

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char>: I'm defending our family. So is she.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: Yeah. I'm her family too.

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char> hugs <char house="Stark">JON</char>.

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char>: Don't forget that.

<stageDirection> EXT. </stageDirection>â€“ KING'S LANDING - DAY
Pan down from a view of the Red Keep to see QYBURN walking up to <char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char> LANNISTER who stares out at the sea.

QYBURN: Your Grace, I'm afraid I bring terrible news. The dead have broken through the Wall.

<char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char>'s lips curl.

<char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char>: Good.

She exits as the camera pans around. <char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char> GREYJOY's Iron Fleet is out at sea and QYBURN turns to look out at them.

<direction> CUT TO </direction>: <char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char>'S SHIP

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char> smiles and stares out at King's Landing from his ship. He walks in the cabin

<direction> CUT TO </direction>: <char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char>'S SHIP - CABIN
<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char> walks inside and past <char house="Greyjoy"> YARA</char> GREYJOY who is tied to a post in the cabin.

<char house="Greyjoy"> YARA</char>: Why don't you just get it over with and kill me?

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char> walks up to her and crouches down.

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char>: But we're family. The last Greyjoys left in the world. The last ones with balls anyway.

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char> chuckles and pops the lid off his drink.

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char>: If I kill you who can I talk to? Hmm?

He sighs.

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char>: I've got a crew full of mutes. It gets lonely at sea.

<char house="Greyjoy"> YARA</char>: Are we in King's Landing?

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char>: Mm.

He turns and offers his drink.

<char house="Greyjoy"> YARA</char>: You picked the losing side.

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char>: Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet somewhere else.

He stands up and turns to look her in the eyes.

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char>: But first I'm gonna fuck the queen.

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char> exits.

<direction> CUT TO </direction>: RED KEEP â€“ GREAT HALL

<char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char> sits on the Iron Throne, <char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char> and <char house="Strickland"> HARRY </char> STRICKLAND stand opposite her.

<char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char>: Twenty-thousand men, is it?

<char house="Strickland"> HARRY </char>: Yes, Your Grace. A few died in transit.

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char>: They cheated at dice. Or maybe I cheated. Someone cheated. They weren't good fighters. You won't miss them.

<char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char>: Horses?

<char house="Strickland"> HARRY </char>: Two thousand.

<char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char>: And elephants?

<char house="Strickland"> HARRY </char>: Uh, no elephants, Your Grace.

<char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char>: That's disappointing. I was told the Golden Company had elephants.

<char house="Strickland"> HARRY </char>: They are excellent beasts, Your Grace, but not well-suited to long sea voyages.

<char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char>: In any event, you are most welcome here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland.

<char house="Strickland"> HARRY </char>: We look forward to fighting on your behalf, Your Grace.

<char house="Strickland"> HARRY </char> bows and exits.

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char>: Am I most welcome here?

<char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char>: You are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest.

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char>: Good. As a true friend and an honored guest

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char> starts to walk forward but GREGOR "THE MOUNTAIN" CLEGANE steps in the way. <char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char> stops but leans towards <char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char>.

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char>: I was hoping we could talk in private.

<char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char>: After the war. That was our agreement.

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char>: Wars sometimes last years.

<char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char>: You want a whore, buy one. You want a queen, earn her.

<char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char> stands and starts to walk out.

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char>: How?

<char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char> stops.

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char>: I've given her justice, an army, and the Iron Fleet, yet she gives me no sign of affection. My heart is nearly broken.

<char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char> turns around to face <char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char>.

<char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char>: You're insolent. I've executed men for less.

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char>: They were lesser men.

<char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char> walks towards the door but halts. She turns around and looks at <char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char>. <char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char> chuckles and follows <char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char>, staring at THE MOUNTAIN as he walks past.

<direction> CUT TO </direction>: KING'S LANDING - BROTHEL

<char house="Stokeworth"> BRONN </char> is on a bed in brothel with three women around him, DIRAH, CRAYAH and MAREI.

DIRAH: I hear the dragon burnt up a thousand Lannister men.

CRAYAH: Burnt up some of my favorite boys.

DIRAH: Archie, was it?

CRAYAH: And William.

DIRAH: Tall handsome William?

CRAYAH: Yeah, tall handsome William.

DIRAH: They said what's left of him could fit in a wine glass.

<char house="Stokeworth"> BRONN </char>: I am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon.

CRAYAH: Did you?

<char house="Stokeworth"> BRONN </char>: Nearly killed it.

MAREI: That's brave.

MAREI pushes <char house="Stokeworth"> BRONN </char> back and climbs on top of him, CRAYAH and DIRAH climb on the bed either side.

CRAYAH: That boy Eddie.

DIRAH: The ginger?

CRAYAH: That's him. Came back with his face burnt right off. He's got no eyelids now.

DIRAH: How does he sleep with no eyelids?

<char house="Stokeworth"> BRONN </char>: All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?

QYBURN (O.S.): Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

<char house="Stokeworth"> BRONN </char> sits up and all four of them look at QYBURN who is standing in the doorway.

<char house="Stokeworth"> BRONN </char>: You're kidding me.

QYBURN: Apologies for the interruption, but the queen did urge me to hurry.

<char house="Stokeworth"> BRONN </char> sighs and removes MAREI from his lap.

<char house="Stokeworth"> BRONN </char>: Sorry, ladies. Another time perhaps.

<char house="Stokeworth"> BRONN </char> stands up and starts dressing himself. CRAYAH walks up to QYBURN.

CRAYAH: You ever get lonely; I am partial to older gentlemen.

The three women leave.

QYBURN: Poor girl. The pox will take her within the year.

<char house="Stokeworth"> BRONN </char> chokes on his drink and coughs.

<char house="Stokeworth"> BRONN </char>: Which girl?

QYBURN: The queen's brothers made promises to you and broke them. Her Grace wants to rectify their mistake.

<char house="Stokeworth"> BRONN </char>: She once gave me a castle and a wife, then rectified me right out of them.

QYBURN: That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers. When Queen Cersei wants something, she pays in advance and in gold. Several chests of it, in fact. Waiting for you in a wagon just outside.

<char house="Stokeworth"> BRONN </char>: So, she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers. If it's the Dragon Queen she's after-

QYBURN: She has other plans for the Targaryen girl.

<char house="Stokeworth"> BRONN </char>: Yeah, well, good luck with that.

QYBURN: Our queen's brothers are unlikely to survive their Northern adventures. But in the event that they do-

A guard brings in a large crossbow, the one that <char house="Lanister">TYRION</char> had previously used to murder his, JAIME's, and <char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char>'s father, TYWIN LANNISTER.

QYBURN: She has a keen sense of poetic justice.

<char house="Stokeworth"> BRONN </char>: That fucking family.

QYBURN: When the Citadel expelled me, I thought I would die poor and alone, but in exchange for my service, Queen Cersei made me her Hand. What would she do for the man who rids her of her treasonous brothers?

QYBURN walks up to <char house="Stokeworth"> BRONN </char> and holds out the crossbow. After a short silence, <char house="Stokeworth"> BRONN </char> takes it. QYBURN exits whilst <char house="Stokeworth"> BRONN </char> looks at the crossbow in his hands.

<direction> CUT TO </direction>: RED KEEP - <char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char>'S QUARTERS

<char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char> is standing behind a chair and sighs.

<char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char>: I wanted those elephants.

The camera pans to reveal <char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char> getting dressed. He sighs and <char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char> walks around the chair and sits down.

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char>: So, how do I compare to the fat king?

<char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char>: You're insulting my late husband?

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char> walks up to her and whispers in her ear.

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char>: Are you offended?

<char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char>: Robert had a different whore every night, but he still didn't know his way around a woman's body.

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char>: And the Kingslayer?

<char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char> glares at <char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char>.

<char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char>: You enjoy risking your neck, don't you?

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char> chuckles.

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char>: Life is boring.

<char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char>: You're not boring, I'll give you that.

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char> smiles and walks up to <char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char>, standing over her.

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char>: Do I please the queen?

<char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char>: You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met. I like that.

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char> chuckles.

<char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char>: But now I want to be alone.

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char> leans down and speaks softly to <char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char>.

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char>: I'm going to put a prince in your belly.

<char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char> exits and tears start to form in <char house="Lanister">CERSEI</char>'s eyes.

<direction> CUT TO </direction>: IRON FLEET

A door can be heard open and then close, a bow string creaks and then an arrow pierces a man's head. More and more of <char house="Greyjoy"> EURON </char>'s men drop dead and a group of men walk over their bodies. <char house="Greyjoy"> YARA</char> is still tied to the post in the cabin and looks up when she hears a bang. Suddenly, a body falls through the door with an axe in his face. <char house="Greyjoy"> THEON </char> GREYJOY walks in after it, retrieves the axe and unties <char house="Greyjoy"> YARA</char>. <char house="Greyjoy"> THEON </char> helps <char house="Greyjoy"> YARA</char> to her feet before she turns to him and headbutts him. <char house="Greyjoy"> THEON </char> falls to the floor, stunned, and <char house="Greyjoy"> YARA</char> extends a hand. <char house="Greyjoy"> THEON </char> grabs her hand and they both exit the cabin.

<direction> CUT TO </direction>: <char house="Greyjoy"> THEON </char>'S SHIPS

Three ships from the Iron Fleet sail together.

<char house="Greyjoy"> YARA</char> (O.S.): Euron can't defend the Iron Islands, not if he's in King's Landing with all his men and his ships.

<char house="Greyjoy"> YARA</char> and <char house="Greyjoy"> THEON </char> stand on deck next to one another.

<char house="Greyjoy"> YARA</char>: We can take our home back.

<char house="Greyjoy"> THEON </char>: Daenerys went north.

<char house="Greyjoy"> YARA</char>: Daenerys will need somewhere to retreat if they can't hold the North. Somewhere the dead can't go.

<char house="Greyjoy"> THEON </char> pauses and sighs.

<char house="Greyjoy"> THEON </char>: You're my queen. I go where you command.

<char house="Greyjoy"> YARA</char> turns to him.

<char house="Greyjoy"> YARA</char>: You want to go to Winterfell. To fight for the Starks. Go. What is dead may never die.

<char house="Greyjoy"> THEON </char> turns to <char house="Greyjoy"> YARA</char>.

<char house="Greyjoy"> THEON </char>: What is dead may never die.

They embrace and <char house="Greyjoy"> YARA</char> leans to his ear.

<char house="Greyjoy"> YARA</char>: But kill the bastards anyway.

<stageDirection> EXT. </stageDirection> WINTERFELL - DAY
<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>' army are camped outside the walls of Winterfell and wagons and horses enter the front gate.

<direction> CUT TO </direction>: WINTERFELL â€“ FRONT GATE

Inside the gate, <char house="Bolton"> WOLKAN </char> is greeting ALYS KARSTARK as the KARSTARKS arrive.

<char house="Bolton"> WOLKAN </char>: Welcome back, my lady. If you'd follow me

<char house="Bolton"> WOLKAN </char> and ALYS exit, <char> VARYS </char>,   <char house="Seaworth"> DAVOS</char> SEAWORTH and <char house="Lanister">TYRION</char> are watching on.

<char> VARYS </char>: The Karstarks.

<char house="Lanister">TYRION</char>: One of the better sigils. Beats an onion, anyway.

  <char house="Seaworth"> DAVOS</char>: Can't argue with that.

The three men start walking with each other.

  <char house="Seaworth"> DAVOS</char>: Not so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks were slaughtering each other on the battlefield. Jon Snow brought peace to the houses.

<char house="Lanister">TYRION</char>: And our queen is grateful.

  <char house="Seaworth"> DAVOS</char>: Her gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point. The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow, not to her. They don't know her. The Free Folk don't know her. I've been up here a while, and I'm telling you, they're stubborn as goats. You want their loyalty, you have to earn it.

<char house="Lanister">TYRION</char> stops and thinks. He then catches up with   <char house="Seaworth"> DAVOS</char> and <char> VARYS </char> who continued to walk.

<char house="Lanister">TYRION</char>: I sense that you're leading to a proposal.

  <char house="Seaworth"> DAVOS</char> looks out over the castle wall.

  <char house="Seaworth"> DAVOS</char>: A proposal is what I'm proposing. On the off chance that we survive the Night King, what if the Seven Kingdoms, for once in their whole shit history, were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man?

<char> VARYS </char> and <char house="Lanister">TYRION</char> walk forward to look over the wall with   <char house="Seaworth"> DAVOS</char>, they see <char house="Stark">JON</char> and <char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> standing and talking with each other.

<char house="Lanister">TYRION</char>: They do make a handsome couple.

<char> VARYS </char>: You overestimate our influence. Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men.

<char house="Lanister">TYRION</char>: I'm not that old.

<char house="Lanister">TYRION</char> looks up at <char> VARYS </char> and then at   <char house="Seaworth"> DAVOS</char>.

<char house="Lanister">TYRION</char>: Not as old as him.

  <char house="Seaworth"> DAVOS</char> chuckles.

<char house="Lanister">TYRION</char>: Our queen respects the wisdom of age.

<char> VARYS </char>: Of course she does. Respect is how the young keep us at a distance, so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth.

<char house="Lanister">TYRION</char>: What is that?

<char> VARYS </char>: Nothing lasts.

<direction> CUT TO </direction>: WINTERFELL â€“ OUTSIDE THE WALL

<char house="Stark">JON</char> and <char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> walk together as men shout indistinctly in the background.

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>: Your sister doesn't like me.

They both stop and turn to one another.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: She doesn't know you. If it makes you feel any better, she didn't like me either when we were growing up.

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>: She doesn't need to be my friend but I am her queen. If she can't respect me-

Three Dothraki men ride up to <char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>.

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> (speaking Dothraki): How many today?

DOTHRAKI MAN #1: Only eighteen goats and eleven sheep.

The Dothraki men ride away.

<char house="Stark">JON</char> (speaking the Common Tongue): What's the matter?

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>: The dragons are barely eating.

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> walks off and <char house="Stark">JON</char> follows.

<stageDirection> EXT. </stageDirection> FLAT CLEARING
<char house="Stark">JON</char> and <char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> walk up to DROGON and RHAEGAL who are standing either side of a pile of bones. The dragons growl softly as they approach.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: What's wrong with them?

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>: They don't like the North.

She touches DROGON's nose and RHAEGAL looks at <char house="Stark">JON</char> and gets close. <char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> climbs on DROGON's back and, smiling, nods towards RHAEGAL.

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>: Go on.

<char house="Stark">JON</char> looks at the dragon, unsure as to what to do.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: I don't know how to ride a dragon.

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>: Nobody does. Until they ride a dragon.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: What if he doesn't want me to?

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>: Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow.

Defeated, <char house="Stark">JON</char> walks around the side of RHAEGAL and then climbs on top whilst grunting.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: What do I hold onto?

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>: Whatever you can.

<char house="Stark">JON</char> grabs onto the dragon, which then proceeds to lift off whilst chittering. <char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> watches and smiles, before leaning forwards, cuing DROGON to follow suit. The dragons continue to fly higher, RHAEGAL turns side-to-side causing <char house="Stark">JON</char> to yell out. They fly over the soldiers outside Winterfell and past <char house="Lanister">TYRION</char>,   <char house="Seaworth"> DAVOS</char> and <char> VARYS </char> who are standing at the castle wall, staring in disbelief as they watch. DROGON flies ahead of RHAEGAL and continues higher before nosediving; RHAEGAL follows after his brother. They continue calmly before reaching a canyon, where the dragons dive straight down, before flying along the canyon floor. Once out of the canyon, RHAEGAL turns off, so <char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> instructs DROGON to do the same. She lands down next to <char house="Stark">JON</char>. <char house="Stark">JON</char> and <char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>, now dismounted from their dragons, walk together away from the dragons.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: You've completely ruined horses for me.

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> giggles and then notices a large waterfall, they stop.

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>: We could stay a thousand years-

She turns back to look at <char house="Stark">JON</char>.

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>: No one would find us.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: We'd be pretty old.

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> chuckles and the two walk up to one another.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: It's cold up here for a southern girl.

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>: So keep your queen warm.

<char house="Stark">JON</char> pulls her in and kisses her. The dragons start to growl softly causing <char house="Stark">JON</char> to pull away.

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>: Don't be afraid.

They smile and continue their kiss in each other's embrace. <char house="Stark">JON</char> opens his eyes to see DROGON staring at them.

INT. WINTERFELL â€“ DAY
<direction> CUT TO </direction>: WINTERFELL - FORGES

<char house="Baratheon"> GENDRY </char> amongst other men occupy the forge, using the furnaces to create weapons from dragonglass

MAN 1: Gendry?

MAN 2: He's here.

<char house="Baratheon"> GENDRY </char> hears and grabs a large axe made from dragonglass. He hands it over to <char house="Clegane"> SANDOR </char>.

<char house="Baratheon"> GENDRY </char>: It isn't easy making a blade that big with dragonglass.

<char house="Clegane"> SANDOR </char>: You're saying you're good, is that it?

<char house="Baratheon"> GENDRY </char>: I'm just saying it's a tricky material to-

<char house="Clegane"> SANDOR </char>: You know who makes weapons for the wildlings? Cripples and cocksuckers. Which one are you?

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char> (O.S.): Leave him be.

<char house="Baratheon"> GENDRY </char> and <char house="Clegane"> SANDOR </char> turn to see <char house="Stark">ARYA</char> and stare at her.

<char house="Clegane"> SANDOR </char>: I heard you were here. You left me to die.

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char>: First I robbed you.

<char house="Clegane"> SANDOR </char> stands up and walks over to her, not breaking eye-contact.

<char house="Clegane"> SANDOR </char>: You're a cold little bitch, aren't you? Guess that's why you're still alive.

<char house="Clegane"> SANDOR </char> exits and <char house="Baratheon"> GENDRY </char> walks up to <char house="Stark">ARYA</char>.

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char>: That was a nice ax you made for him. You've gotten better.

<char house="Baratheon"> GENDRY </char>: Yeah, thanks. So have you.

He pauses.

<char house="Baratheon"> GENDRY </char>: I mean, you look good.

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char>: Thanks. So do you.

<char house="Baratheon"> GENDRY </char> pauses, he then walks away whilst still talking to her.

<char house="Baratheon"> GENDRY </char>: It's not a bad place to grow up, if it wasn't so cold.

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char> follows.

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char>: Stay close to that forge, then.

<char house="Baratheon"> GENDRY </char>: Is that a command, Lady Stark?

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char>: Don't call me that.

<char house="Baratheon"> GENDRY </char>: As you wish, milady.

She smiles and chuckles.

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char>: Here's my wish.

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char> hands <char house="Baratheon"> GENDRY </char> a piece of parchment with a detachable spear drawn on it, with a dragonglass tip.

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char>: Can you make it?

<char house="Baratheon"> GENDRY </char>: What do you need something like this for?

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char>: Can you make it or not?

<char house="Baratheon"> GENDRY </char>: You already have a sword. What's that?

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char> removes a Valyrian steel dagger from her person and hands it to him.

<char house="Baratheon"> GENDRY </char>: It's Valyrian steel. I always knew you were just another rich girl.

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char> smirks and takes the dagger back.

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char>: You don't know any other rich girls.

<char house="Stark">ARYA</char> walks off before turning back and smiling and then back around again without breaking stride.

<direction> CUT TO </direction>: WINTERFELL â€“ <char house="Stark">SANSA</char>'S QUARTERS

<char house="Stark">SANSA</char> is reading a letter when there is a knock on the door.

<char house="Stark">SANSA</char>: Come in.

The door creaks open and then shuts. <char house="Stark">JON</char> walks in before stopping next to her. <char house="Stark">SANSA</char> sighs.

<char house="Stark">SANSA</char>: Lord Glover wishes us good fortune, but he's staying in Deepwood Motte with his men.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: "House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years." Isn't that what he said?

<char house="Stark">SANSA</char>: "I will stand behind Jon Snow," he said.

<char house="Stark">SANSA</char> stands up and walks a bit before stopping and turning to look at him

<char house="Stark">SANSA</char>: "The King in the North."

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: I told you we needed allies.

<char house="Stark">SANSA</char>: You didn't tell me you were going to abandon your crown.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: I never wanted a crown. All I wanted was to protect the North. I brought two armies home with me, two dragons.

<char house="Stark">SANSA</char>: And a Targaryen queen.

<char house="Stark">JON</char> sighs.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her? I fought them, Sansa. Twice. You want to worry about who holds what title, I'm telling you it doesn't matter. Without her, we don't stand a chance.

They fall silent and <char house="Stark">JON</char> sighs.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: Do you have any faith in me at all?

<char house="Stark">SANSA</char>: You know I do.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: She'll be a good queen. For all of us. She's not her father.

<char house="Stark">SANSA</char> sighs.

<char house="Stark">SANSA</char>: No, she's much prettier.

<char house="Stark">JON</char> scoffs.

<char house="Stark">SANSA</char>: Did you bend the knee to save the North or because you love her?

He looks up at her.

<direction> CUT TO </direction>: WINTERFELL - LIBRARY

A door creaks open and then shuts as <char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> and <char house="Mormont"> JORAH</char> enter the library. They walk to where <char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char> TARLY sits and <char house="Mormont"> JORAH</char> nods in his direction. <char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> clears her throat.

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: Oh!

Startled, <char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char> stands up and dusts himself off.

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>: So you're the man?

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: Um. Which man am I, Your Grace?

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>: The one who saved Ser Jorah when no one else could.

<char house="Mormont"> JORAH</char>: They could, they just wouldn't.

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>: I'll have to make some changes in the Citadel when I take my throne. A great service merits a great reward.

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: Oh, it's my honor to serve you, Your Grace.

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>: Well, there must be something I could give you.

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char> nods.

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: If it's not too much trouble, I could use a pardon.

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>: For what crime?

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: Um, I borrowed a few books from the Citadel.

<char house="Mormont"> JORAH</char> and <char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> both smile to themselves.

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: And also a sword.

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> looks at him, confused.

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>: From the Citadel?

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: From my family. It's been in House Tarly for generations.

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>' face drops and she looks concerned.

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: It would've been mine anyway, eventually, but my father had other ideas.

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>: Not Randyll Tarly?

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: You know him?

He looks at her, surprised. <char house="Mormont"> JORAH</char> looks guilty.

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>: I offered to let him retain his lands and titles if he bent the knee. He refused.

<char house="Mormont"> JORAH</char> looks down as <char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char> tried to hold it together. He gulps.

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: Well At least I'll be allowed home again, now that my brother's the lord.

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>' face is stern.

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>: Your brother stood with your father.

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>'s lips start quivering and his breath becomes shaky.

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: Hm. Thank you, Your Grace. For telling me. And m- may I?

<char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char>: Of course.

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char> exits quickly, and <char house="Targaryen">DAENERYS</char> and <char house="Mormont"> JORAH</char> look at each other.

<direction> CUT TO </direction>: WINTERFELL - COURTYARD

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char> heads outside before being startled by a horse carrying a wagon. He stops and sees <char house="Stark">BRAN</char> staring at him from across the courtyard. He walks over.

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: What are you doing out here?

<char house="Stark">BRAN</char>: Waiting, for an old friend. It's time to tell Jon the truth.

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char> shakes his head.

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: No, no. You're his brother. Shouldn't you tell him?

<char house="Stark">BRAN</char>: I'm not his brother. He trusts you more than anyone. Now's the time.

<direction> CUT TO </direction>: WINTERFELL - CRYPTS

<char house="Stark">JON</char> blows out a candle and stands back to look at his father, <char house="Tollett"> EDD </char>ARD STARK's, statue. He sighs and hears a man grunting and a thud. He walks around the corner to see <char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char> stand up.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: Sam?

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to be down here.

<char house="Stark">JON</char> grabs <char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char> and hugs him tightly.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: Were you hiding from me?

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: Of course not.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: What are you doing in Winterfell? Or did you read every book in the Citadel already?

He looks at <char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>'s face and sees he is worried.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: What's wrong? Gilly? Is she all right?

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: She's good.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: Little Sam?

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: Don't you know?

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: Know what?

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: Daenerys. She executed my father and brother. They were her prisoners.

<char house="Stark">JON</char> looks at <char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>, shocked at the news he is hearing.

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: She didn't tell you.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: I'm so sorry. We need to end this war.

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: Would you have done it?

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: Well, I've executed men who disobeyed me.

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: You've also spared men. Thousands of wildlings when they refused to kneel.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: I wasn't a king.

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: But you were. You've always been.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: I gave up my crown, Sam.

<char house="Stark">JON</char> starts walking away, <char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char> follows.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: I bent the knee. I'm not King in the North anymore.

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: I'm not talking about the King in the North. I'm talking about the King of the bloody Seven Kingdoms.

<char house="Stark">JON</char> stops immediately, pauses and turns around.

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: Bran and I worked it out. I had a High Septon's diary. Bran had whatever Bran has.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: What are you talking about?

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: Your mother was Lyanna Stark.

<char house="Stark">JON</char> exhales sharply.

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: And your father- your real father was Rhaegar Targaryen. You've never been a bastard. You're Aegon Targaryen, true heir to the Iron Throne. I'm sorry, I know it's a lot to take in.

<char house="Stark">JON</char> walks up to <char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>:

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: My father was the most honorable man I ever met. You're saying he lied to me all my life.

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: No. Your father- Well, Ned Stark. He promised your mother he'd always protect you. And he did. Robert would have murdered you if he knew. You're the true king. Aegon Targaryen, Sixth of His Name, Protector of the Realm, all of it.

<char house="Stark">JON</char> takes a couple of steps back whilst breathing heavily.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: Daenerys is our queen.

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: She shouldn't be.

<char house="Stark">JON</char>: That's treason.

<char house="Tarly">SAMWELL</char>: It's the truth. You gave up your crown to save your people. Would she do the same?

<stageDirection> EXT. </stageDirection> LAST HEARTH - NIGHT
<char house="Dondarrion">  BERIC</char> DONDARRION and <char house="Giantsbane"> TORMUND </char> with a group of others walk into Last Hearth to find it deserted. <char house="Dondarrion">  BERIC</char> enters the building first, the others following cautiously behind. While exploring a dark hallway, a sudden noise startles the group and they press themselves against the walls, weapons drawn as the sounds turn into footprints. Suddenly, <char house="Giantsbane"> TORMUND </char> leaps around the corner to confront the source of the noise with a roar, the rest of the group yelling in preparation to attack the enemy, but instead they find DOLOROUS <char house="Tollett"> EDD </char> and others of the Night's Watch.

<char house="Tollett"> EDD </char>: Stay back, he's got blue eyes!

<char house="Giantsbane"> TORMUND </char>: I've always had blue eyes!

Everyone pauses and lowers their weapons with sighs of relief.

<char house="Dondarrion">  BERIC</char>: Did you find anyone?

<char house="Tollett"> EDD </char> leads <char house="Dondarrion">  BERIC</char> and <char house="Giantsbane"> TORMUND </char> through a large hall, faintly illuminated by <char house="Dondarrion">  BERIC</char>'s ignited sword. When they reach the far wall there is a young boy impaled on the wall with several spirals of limbs surrounding him.

<char house="Tollett"> EDD </char>: The Umber boy.

<char house="Dondarrion">  BERIC</char>: It's a message. From the Night King.

<char house="Giantsbane"> TORMUND </char>: His army's between us and Winterfell. We're on foot.

<char house="Tollett"> EDD </char>: We rode down from Castle Black. We can double up on the horses.

<char house="Giantsbane"> TORMUND </char>: If the horses last, we'll get there before the dead.

<char house="Umber"> UMBER </char>'s eyes open.

<char house="Giantsbane"> TORMUND </char>: We just have to hope the Night King doesn't come first-

<char house="Umber"> UMBER </char> starts shrieking, the three men start clamoring and <char house="Dondarrion">  BERIC</char> shoves his sword in the boy, both igniting him and causing him to shriek even louder. The shrieking eventually stops, but not before the entire mosaic of appendages has been engulfed by flames.

Men are marching along the long road up to Winterfell, a cloaked figure rides a horse.

The cloaked man rides the horse up to the stable and dismounts as men around shout indistinctly. He removes his hood and JAIME LANNISTER's face is revealed. He sighs and looks around the courtyard before <char house="Stark">BRAN</char> catches his eye. JAIME stares at him in disbelief at the camera zooms in on <char house="Stark">BRAN</char>'s face.
